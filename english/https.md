# Configure HTTPS reverse proxy

> If you need to merge ports, please refer to [Configure HTTPS Reverse Proxy and Merge Ports](https-merge-ports.md)  
> If you need to use port 443, it is recommended to refer to [Configure HTTPS reverse proxy for port 443 on the same host](443.md)

## Generate SSL certificate

You can generate a 90 day free certificate (with unlimited renewal) for your domain name or public IP on a free SSL website to establish a secure HTTPS connection.

### ⚠Don't leak your private key! Private key leakage can cause HTTPS to become ineffective!

<br />

## Configure reverse proxy

If the version of nginx that comes with the package manager of the operating system is too low (such as Ubuntu), please compile and install the latest version of nginx.

```nginx
# The following http blocks are the ones that need to be understood and modified, please make changes according to your needs and running environment.
# Assumptions:
#    The port that Daemon truly listens to: 24444
#    Port after Daemon proxy: 12444
#    The port that the web panel truly listens to: 23333
#    Port after proxy on the web panel side: 12333
#    SSL certificate directory: /etc/nginx/ssl/domain.com.crt
#    SSL private key directory: /etc/nginx/ssl/domain.com_ECC.key
#    You need to allow access to the primary domain domain.com and any of its subdomains

```

**After configuration is completed, reload Nginx configuration (the following command is used for Linux operating system)**
```bash
systemctl reload nginx
```

<br />

## Client access panel

If the domain name is ***domain.com*** and the reverse proxy port is 12333, then the browser needs to use this address to access the panel:  
```
https://domain.com:12333/
```

**⚠Please ensure that all ports after reverse proxy pass through the server's firewall, otherwise you will not be able to access them properly.**  
⚠If using NAT ports, please ensure that the internal and external port numbers are consistent.  

<br />

## Connect to Daemon

### Local loopback address  
> In **Daemons**, enter the address as ***localhost***, port as the port number after the reverse proxy (for example, 12444), and click **Connect** or **Update** on the right.  
> **⚠You cannot fill in the address as *ws://localhost*! This causes the browser to try to connect using the HTTP protocol!**  
> 
> ![connect_default_daemon_12444.webp](../images/connect_default_daemon_12444.webp)

### Remote address  
>In **Daemons**, add ***wss://*** protocol header before the original address, enter the port number of the reverse proxy (such as 12444), and click **Connect** or **Update** on the right.  
> For example, the following two original addresses:
> > domain.com  
> > ws://domain.com  
> 
> After modification:
> > wss://domain.com  
> 
> ![connect_wss_daemon_12444.webp](../images/connect_wss_daemon_12444.webp)
