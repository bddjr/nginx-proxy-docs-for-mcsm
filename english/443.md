# Configure HTTPS reverse proxy and merge Web and Daemon ports

> This article is based on the modification of [Configure HTTPS reverse proxy and merge ports](https-merge-ports.md)  
> This article was not written by an official developer of MCSManager.  

<br />

## The principle of merging ports

MCSManager access to the beginning of the Daemon side path (does not conflict with the beginning of the web panel path):  
> /socket.io/  
> /upload/  
> /download/  

The priority of location matching in Nginx from high to low is:  
```nginx
location =/test.txt {}              # Match perfectly equal paths
location ~ (^/path/)|(^/path2/) {}  # Matching Regular Expressions
location /path/ {}                  # Matches the beginning of a single path
```

Based on these characteristics, merge the two ports to reduce the number of public network listening ports.

<br />

## Generate SSL certificate

You can generate a 90 day free certificate (with unlimited renewal) for your domain name or public IP on a free SSL website to establish a secure HTTPS connection.  
> <a href="https://zerossl.com/" target="_blank">https://zerossl.com/</a>  

### ⚠Don't leak your private key! Private key leakage can cause HTTPS to become ineffective!

<br />

## Configure reverse proxy

If the version of nginx that comes with the package manager of the operating system is too low (such as Ubuntu), please compile and install the latest version of nginx.

Assumptions:  
Use ***mcsm.example.com*** to connect  

```nginx
http {
    # Configure SSL certificate. The SSL ports monitored below will default to using this certificate.
    #SSL-START
    ssl_certificate "/etc/nginx/ssl/example.com.crt";
    ssl_certificate_key "/etc/nginx/ssl/example.com_ECC.key";

    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout  10m;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.0 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3; # Allow connections to be established using these encryption methods
    ssl_verify_client off; # Do not verify the client's certificate
    #SSL-END

    # Enable gzip compression by default during transmission
    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/javascript application/xml application/json;
    gzip_proxied any;
    # The compression level during transmission, the higher the level, the more CPU is consumed by compression, with a maximum of 9 levels. Usually, 5 levels are sufficient
    gzip_comp_level 5;
    # Compression is required only when the transmission size reaches 1k. It is meaningless to compress small content
    gzip_min_length 1k;

    # The server in the response header returns only nginx, not the version number.
    server_tokens  off;

    # There is no limit on the file size uploaded by the client
    client_max_body_size 0;

    server {
        # This is used to prevent cross domain access.

        listen [::]:80 default ; #IPv6

        # If the domain name used cannot match in other servers {}, it will match here.
        server_name _ ;

        # When using HTTPS access, disconnect directly without returning the certificate.
        # If you need a set of DNS CDN high defense, you should not delete this block, which is more likely to lead to certificate leakage, attackers scan the IP address directly bound to the source IP and domain name together.
        ssl_reject_handshake on;

        # When using HTTP access, disconnect.

        gzip off;

        # Proxy Daemon

        # The domain name you use when you visit

            add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000"; 
        }
    }
}
```

**After configuration is completed, reload Nginx configuration (the following command is used for Linux operating system)**
```bash
systemctl reload nginx
```

<br />

## Client access panel

```
https://mcsm.example.com/
```

**⚠Please ensure that all ports after reverse proxy pass through the server's firewall, otherwise you will not be able to access them properly.**  

<br />

## Connect to Daemon

### Local loopback address  
> In **Daemons**, fill in address ***localhost***, port 443, and click **Connect** or **Update**.  
> **⚠You cannot fill in the address as *ws://localhost*! This causes the browser to try to connect using the HTTP protocol!**
